# Weather App
 A weather Application made with Flask Python

 Basic and very "Bare Bones" at the moment. This was created so I could learn Flask methods and how to use API.

 How to Use:

 Very Simple - enter an city or country in the search bar and the app will load some very basic information.

 Returned information -

    - Temerature 
    - "Feels like"
    - Description
    - Humidity
    - Wind Speed

Future updates:

Next upgrade is to add 5-day weather forcast and 7-day weather forecast. Once this is done I will be then looking to add an last 5 search feature that shows what the results was when searched.

As I continule to learn Flask I would like to implement this into a Weather Website showing Storm patterns in X amount of years. e.g. How many storms has UK had in the last 5 years.

In terms of future tech I would like to implement a login feature to work with a blog, bascialy turning the whole app into a blog about the weather. This will allow me to use and learn SQLAlchemy for the database storage and manlipualtion of data.

Struggles:

Jinja2 Templating - Still not 100% sure on this and have only used a few lines to show the search results.

CSS - Continules to be my major struggle - I handerstand the syntax but putting it together is still a struggle - which is why i created this as a web based app instead of an GUI App like the Expense Tracker app.

Conculusion:

I had loads of fun learning new methods and Frameworks for this project. While very basic and not as impressavie as the tracker It is an good base to continule learning Frameworks and other tech - such as Tailwind CSS and OAuth for the blog when implemented.
